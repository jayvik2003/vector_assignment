\item Students of a school staged a rally for cleanliness campaign. They walked through the lanes in two groups. One group walked through the lanes AB, BC and CA; while the other through AC, CD and DA. Then they cleaned the area enclosed within their lanes. If AB = 9 m, BC = 40 m, CD = 15 m, DA = 28 m and $\angle B = 90\degree$, which group cleaned more area and by how much? Draw the corresponding figure.  Find the total area cleaned by the students (neglecting the width of the lanes).

\item Sanya has a piece of land which is in the shape of a rhombus. She wants her one daughter and one son to work on the land and produce different crops. She divided the land in two equal parts. If the perimeter of the land is 400 m and one of the diagonals is 160 m, how much area each of them will get for their crops? Draw the rhombus.

\item Three girls Reshma, Salma and Mandip are playing a game by standing on a circle of radius 5m drawn in a park. Reshma throws a ball to Salma, Salma to Mandip, Mandip to Reshma. If the distance between Reshma and Salma and between Salma and Mandip is 6m each, what is the distance between Reshma and Mandip?
\item A circular park of radius 20m is situated in a colony. Three boys Ankur, Syed and David are sitting at equal distance on its boundary each having a toy telephone in his hands to talk each other. Find the length of the string of each phone.
